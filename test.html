	Too many snarky direct-message comments made on the side of zoom calls to recall. Oh, and at the GC after Kaya announced she is joining Teach For All, Kate almost had a heart attack cause she was worried it wasn't budgeted for. -Sri

	I enjoyed sitting on the swings in the TFA DC office talking about her development and things happening on the team. -Rebecca Helmer

<li>
	Her support (virtually and in person) in my first few months at the org where everything was so confusing. Her simple act of 'naming' this and offering to translate the ways we operate and the language we speak (FULL of acronyms) for a newbie like me was so significant! -Whitney

	I loved getting to have Kate lead my Leading Self group. It's been so helpful to connect with her since she has the lens of my work in the group and our team - I feel grateful to have her good thoughts and energy around how I can continue to grow and develop in the ways I have identified. -Hannah V

	I wish we had more together but time zones/different teams have been a challenge! But my favorite Kate moment is knowing that she has been a Skype/ping away - especially when I want to give feedback or say something that may be hard for others to listen to - and she coaches me on the spot as to how to do this! -Ankana

	Wayyyyyy too much wine at La Jambe before she moved to Richmond. Zoom dates between Sasha/Taco and Kip. -Justyna

	There are so many! Kate Sunshine is by far one of my favorite people in the whole world - there is never a dull conversation or a moment not filled with support and friendship. One of my favorite nights was when we went to Takoda in DC and just ended up talking for hours about our mutual dislike of the recent election and getting into so many meaningful conversations. I also love when I get to see her dogs on Zoom! Haha We've been through so much in my years at TFAll - the shifts in our team, our roles and our colleagues - and I always know I can count on Kate to be there for me. She's seen me through my biggest lows and offered so much support and love, and honestly TFAll would not be TFAll without Kate Sunshine! -Thaisa

	Any moment in person at an in-person event is always a pleasure! -Becca

	Kate was my roommate at every event for a solid two years of my TFAll life, and it was EVERYTHING. -Samantha

	My first intro to Kate was my onboarding session with her where she shared the "guess who" presentation she'd made about our team. I totally failed, as I didn't know anyone, but LOVED that she'd taken the time to create it. From dancing at an Armenian wedding venue to puzzling through grant requirements on finance calls, I truly always enjoy interacting with Kate. -Nisha

	6AM hot bikram yoga. Kate killed it and went on to slay the rest of the day (as she does). Whereas I'm pretty sure I blacked out after 15-minutes and went on to take multiple dehydration naps that day. -Z

	That time Kate interviewed me and there was an armed police raid of my neighbor's houseâ€¦ -Hannah S.

	She was one of my very first meet and greets and took me to a cool Ethiopian coffee spot in DC. The rest is history. -Kim
