						</li>
						<li>
							An amazing mentor! -Craig
						</li>
						<li>
							Kate is her last name personified! She is warm, and shines the best light on those around her. Also, killer hoops, raised eyebrow. -Anne
						</li>
						<li>
							Thoughtful, Reflective, "on it" -Rebecca H
						</li>
						<li>
							The mastermind -Becca
						</li>
						<li>
							RELIABLE, TRUSTWORTHY, COMMITTED - AN ABSOLUTE GEM THAT I WOULD ALWAYS WANT ON MY TEAM! -Whitney

						</li>
						<li>
							Kate is quite literally a ray of sunshine! She is the most approachable, empathetic individual. She is so patient, cares deeply about ensuring everyone feels included. She’s a great listener and supporter. -Ankana
						</li>
						<li>
							Kate is patient, thoughtful, kind, and constantly striving to do her best for her team, the org, and the network -Justyna
						</li>
						<li>

						</li>
						<li>
							A super positive team member and a wise sage on all things money and process related -Hannah S
