						</li>
						<li>
							A super positive team member and a wise sage on all things money and process related -Hannah S
						</li>
						<li>
							Kate is a critical thought-partnering wizardress and probably a time traveler, because she's always doing impossible things in impossible amounts of time. Also she stands all day, works all night, never eats on camera, and rarely complains - so definitely some type of alien warlock. -Z
						</li>
						<li>
							Kate is the heart and rock of our team. She is my one of most grounding forces, supportive colleague, amazing friend, brilliant strategist and trusted adviser. -Patty

					<label>Qualify Stage (The qualities we admire & appreciate)</label>
					<ul>
						<li>
							Kate is on top of her game - she manages the ever-shifting mountain of data that we call our best path with grace and seeming ease. Having to frequently ask her team members to provide updates, etc. is a tricky position to be in, and I really appreciate how approachable she is - it's just so easy and fun to work with her. -Nisha
						</li>
						<li>
							Her sense of responsibility, her diligence, her commitment to this organization, her wicked sense of humor, and her laugh and smile. -Samantha
						</li>
						<li>
							Cool and calm under pressure. No drama, straight business, always got it together! -Whitney
						</li>
						<li>
							Authenticity, willingness to listen and hear perspectives -Ankana
						</li>
						<li>
							Her generosity. Her sense of humor. Her insight and thoughtfulness on basically any topic you could possibly throw at her. Her ability to BRIO pretty much anyone into having another drink and maybe possibly going out dancing until 4am on a Tuesday night. -Justyna
						</li>
						<li>
							She is genuinely caring. Smart (obviously). -Kenny
						</li>
						<li>
							Her experience, positivity, and perspective -Craig
						</li>
						<li>
							Her ability to never compromise her thoughtfulness/thoroughness/attention to detail/and care for co-workers no matter how intense or complex the task! Also, her endless patience with navigating the most mundane/painstaking of Salesforce questions. -Kim
						</li>
						<li>
							Fun, collaborative, smart, positive -Radha
						</li>
						<li>
							I love how Kate is always up for a challenge. When faced with a tough situation, she takes a breath, steels herself and then dives in. This makes her the ideal person to face a tough situation alongside. -Phil
						</li>
						<li>
							Her positivity in the CRAZIEST situations and times I want to scream... and she somehow manages it with a smile. -Sri
						</li>
						<li>
							She is lovely, smart, kind, funny and centering. She has the ability to see so many angles and think through a big project very thoughtfully and purposefully. She is just amazing! -Patty
						</li>
						<li>
							Listening skills; humor; positivity -Betsy
						</li>
						<li>
							I appreciate her openness to learning, her deep capacity for self reflection, and her focus on continuously improving in the service of both better outcomes and stronger relationships and team. -Rebecca H
						</li>
						<li>
							warmth and positivity, sense of possibility, support to make ideas happen, helicopter view -Lucy
						</li>
						<li>
							Kate's positivity and unwillingness to buckle in the face of any challenges are such key reasons for her success in her role! I have never seen an obstacle that could stump Kate Sunshine. Her mind is also insanely organized - she can look at any problem and give you like 5 different solutions. She also has such a presence around her that she puts you at ease by just being nearby. Kate inspires me each and every day and I couldn't have lasted at TFAll without her. She's such a fantastic manager as well - she really knows how to support others to become the leaders they are meant to be. I could literally go on and on about Kate, but the last thing I will say that I admire about her is her desire for growth. She never stops wanting to learn and I appreciate that about her so much because it pushed the rest of us to want more as well. -Thaisa
						</li>
						<li>
							Kate is always willing to jump in and help out. She's the type of person I want to work with-- our work doesn't overlap all that frequently, but when it does I always enjoy working with her. -Jared
						</li>
						<li>
							Thoughtful, thorough, committed, devoted -Sarabeth
						</li>
						<li>
							humour, sunshiny outlook on life, down to earth, honesty, supportive, warm -Monica
						</li>
						<li>
							Willingness to help and answer any question, no matter how simple or complex! -Hannah
						</li>
						<li>
							Warmth, calm under pressure, rigorous, dependable -Becca
						</li>
						<li>
							Her ability to bring positivity to all situations, especially those that are challenging! She always is able to find at least one (but often many) ideas that help me to shift my mindset. -Anne

					<label>Engage Stage (The moments we’ve shared)</label>
					<ul>
						<li>
							Not appropriate to share at work ;-) -Betsy
						</li>
						<li>
							early morning budget chats about social innovation; navigating a brave new world of contingent funding with Sri & Alex -Lucy
						</li>
						<li>
							Working in our old, old cave-like DC office :) -Sarabeth
						</li>
						<li>
							Too many snarky direct-message comments made on the side of zoom calls to recall. Oh, and at the GC after Kaya announced she is joining Teach For All, Kate almost had a heart attack cause she was worried it wasn't budgeted for. -Sri
						</li>
						<li>
							Getting the connectivity work going and managing to have fun in the process! -Radha
						</li>
						<li>
							She interviewed me for my first interview for Teach For All years ago. -Craig
						</li>
						<li>
							Um stepping back together on everything for the last 8 years?!?! -Patty
						</li>
						<li>
							I enjoyed sitting on the swings in the TFA DC office talking about her development and things happening on the team. -Rebecca Helmer
						</li>
						<li>
							Her support (virtually and in person) in my first few months at the org where everything was so confusing. Her simple act of 'naming' this and offering to translate the ways we operate and the language we speak (FULL of acronyms) for a newbie like me was so significant! -Whitney
						</li>
						<li>
							I loved getting to have Kate lead my Leading Self group. It's been so helpful to connect with her since she has the lens of my work in the group and our team - I feel grateful to have her good thoughts and energy around how I can continue to grow and develop in the ways I have identified. -Hannah V
						</li>
						<li>
							I wish we had more together but time zones/different teams have been a challenge! But my favorite Kate moment is knowing that she has been a Skype/ping away - especially when I want to give feedback or say something that may be hard for others to listen to - and she coaches me on the spot as to how to do this! -Ankana
						</li>
						<li>
							Wayyyyyy too much wine at La Jambe before she moved to Richmond. Zoom dates between Sasha/Taco and Kip. -Justyna
						</li>
						<li>
							Memorable (or maybe we want to forget?) - Kate coaching me through my first few months at Teach For All -Kenny
						</li>
						<li>
							There are so many! Kate Sunshine is by far one of my favorite people in the whole world - there is never a dull conversation or a moment not filled with support and friendship. One of my favorite nights was when we went to Takoda in DC and just ended up talking for hours about our mutual dislike of the recent election and getting into so many meaningful conversations. I also love when I get to see her dogs on Zoom! Haha We've been through so much in my years at TFAll - the shifts in our team, our roles and our colleagues - and I always know I can count on Kate to be there for me. She's seen me through my biggest lows and offered so much support and love, and honestly TFAll would not be TFAll without Kate Sunshine! -Thaisa
						</li>
						<li>
							Any moment in person at an in-person event is always a pleasure! -Becca
						</li>
						<li>
							Kate was my roommate at every event for a solid two years of my TFAll life, and it was EVERYTHING. -Samantha
						</li>
						<li>
							My first intro to Kate was my onboarding session with her where she shared the "guess who" presentation she'd made about our team. I totally failed, as I didn't know anyone, but LOVED that she'd taken the time to create it. From dancing at an Armenian wedding venue to puzzling through grant requirements on finance calls, I truly always enjoy interacting with Kate. -Nisha
						</li>
						<li>
							Armenia, Colombia -Monica
						</li>
						<li>
							6AM hot bikram yoga. Kate killed it and went on to slay the rest of the day (as she does). Whereas I'm pretty sure I blacked out after 15-minutes and went on to take multiple dehydration naps that day. -Z
						</li>
						<li>
							That time Kate interviewed me and there was an armed police raid of my neighbor's house… -Hannah S.
						</li>
						<li>
							She was one of my very first meet and greets and took me to a cool Ethiopian coffee spot in DC. The rest is history. -Kim
						</li>

			<ul>
				<li>
					Ugh I can't even begin to answer this - everything?!!? Patty
				</li>
				<li>
					What has Kate not given us? Her time, her commitment, her genius brain! Kate gives everything to our organization and team. She wants us to consistently create inclusive and collaborative environments - and she is always thinking of ways to internalize that within herself as well. Kate has taught me so much in my years at TFAll - I feel like I went through the Kate Sunshine School of Legit Rockstars because I came into my role so new and unassuming, and I emerged someone who can turn out a stellar project plan, organize the world, thought partner like no one's business and express myself in so many ways. Kate helped me with all of this! I am so lucky to count her as a friend and colleague, but she's also my mentor and I look up to her so much and she makes me such a better TFAller and person. I am so lucky to have had her manage me for the past 5 years, because I can honestly say she has helped to shape me and my experience at TFAll. -Thaisa
				</li>
				<li>
					helping me to understand how Teach For All fundraises; helping me to secure new headcount for Social Innovation & the Connectivity Team; reassuring me about funding priorities -Lucy 
				</li>
				<li>
					She offers me 30 minutes each week to mentor me in my new role. She provides me with some amazing insights on the culture and norms of Teach For All. -Craig
				</li>
				<li>
					
				She has taught me so much about how things work at Teach For All, and always has time to help me with things I'm struggling with or that I don't understand. -Hannah S
				</li>
				<li>
					I've learned a ton through our conversations about management, team culture, and development. -Rebecca H
				</li>
				<li>
					So much! She listened, helped me gain clarity on some very difficult situations, & boosted my confidence -Monica
				</li>
				<li>
					Kate gave me my job and all of the subsequent anxiety attacks that have followed ;) -Z
				</li>
				<li>
					She has given her team and the organization the gift of being such a foundation pillar through any and all transitions. -Becca
				</li>
				<li>
					Always generous with her time and thought partnership! She has jumped in to manage staff and teams and to support transitions and leads just so seamlessly. She is a real team player - within her team and across teams - and brings so much TFAll institutional knowledge important for our growth and improvement. -Whitney
				</li>
				<li>
					EVERYTHING! Kate's patience in reviewing budgets alone deserves a medal :) -Hannah V
				</li>
				<li>
					Been such a great supporter, friend, & mentor -Ankana
				</li>
				<li>
					Literally EVERYTHING. Kate has played an integral part in my professional development at TFAll across every role I've held here, and has been an anchor for my sanity over the past 4.5 years. -Justyna
				</li>
				<li>
					She's great at rolling with things! Able to go with the flow always! -Radha
				</li>
				<li>
					She has helped me build my capacity across GD's systems and is an example of how I hope to help others navigate my own portfolio. -Kim
				</li>
				<li>
					She gives me grace during times of stress; she has taught me to be a better listener -Betsy 
				</li>
				<li>
					Kate has pretty much taught me everything I should not be doing with donors, mostly through my attempts which she corrected.  She's also taught me patience and positivity no matter what is happening -Sri
				</li>
				<li>
					Time... always time and space to talk -Kenny
				</li>
				<li>
					Kate always checks in with you personally, she'll send you a personal zoom chat and say "hey, how are you?" and it always feels so generous and thoughtful. -Sarabeth
				</li>
				<li>
					I have asked Kate so many stupid questions about Salesforce processes, finance systems, etc., and have never once come away from those interactions feeling stupid. Kate has patiently expanded my knowledge of our complex team systems and is a role-model for me as I continue to learn to better manage large amounts of data and keep my mini-team systems running smoothly - Kate somehow does this flawlessly for our entire team! -Nisha
